Bi-linear interpolation on a rectilinear grid in two dimensions

The goal is to find the function value at a random point within our 2D grid
The size of our 2D grid will be 10x10
The functions defined on our grid is cos(x)*sin(y) and the Rosenbrock function

The x and y coordinate that we want an interpolated value for is:
x	=      3.43 
y	=      6.81 

Interpolated value z(x,y) for the cos(x)*sin(x):
  -0.48444 
Analytical result:
z(x,y) = -0.48471

Interpolated value z(x,y) for the Rosenbrock function:
    2432.6 
Analytical result:
z(x,y) = 2429
